# Breaking-Curse-of-Dimensionality-Solving-8D-Problems-with-10-Variables-on-RTX-2070-via-TQR-Computing
By leveraging topological quantum relaxation physical computing, the Turing mechanism and the von Neumann architecture are transcended, breaking the chip-based digital numerical simulation paradigm; RTX 2070 combined with ADC computing module enables an improvement of more than 10⁸ in overall computational power relative to traditional computation.

The 7.7.3 suite is the test suite for the ADC computing module. It contains 25 test cases ranging from simple to extremely difficult. Except for being fully translated into English and having the explicit names of the test cases removed, its test content is completely identical to that of the 7.7.2 test suite.

The 7.7.3 test suite serves two purposes. First, it is used to examine whether the ADC computing module can achieve convergence under a wide range of extreme test conditions. Second, it provides an indirect comparison with the Fugaku supercomputer, which is known to have difficulty passing certain test cases under eight-dimensional (8D) conditions. This comparison demonstrates that the combined computational capability of an NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU and the ADC module—particularly in handling nonlocal, high-dimensional, parallel coupled mathematical problems—exceeds that of the Fugaku supercomputer.

The remaining uploaded files consist of execution logs and JSON files recording the computational processes produced by running the ADC module. These files demonstrate that all computations are genuine and correspond to real execution processes. A particularly notable feature in the logs is that NaN values remain zero throughout the computations, which provides strong evidence that these results are not produced by discretized mathematics under the Turing computational paradigm. Furthermore, the convergence processes recorded in the JSON files clearly show a continuous, natural relaxation trajectory, rather than traditional floating-point arithmetic–based computation.

In addition, to facilitate a deeper understanding of the principles of topological quantum relaxation computation, I have also uploaded a separate physics manuscript in addition to the main paper. This supplementary manuscript provides a clearer exposition of the newly proposed physical energy field theory, which constitutes the physical foundation of both the ADC module and quantum relaxation computation.

Although subsequent papers on dynamic structured mathematics have already been completed, they have not yet been formally organized. It is important to emphasize that the ADC equation represents only one equation within the broader framework of dynamic structured mathematics, and its conceptual scope extends beyond the ADC equation itself. Dynamic structured mathematics is particularly well suited for nonlocal, high-dimensional, parallel coupled computations, and its computational efficiency is not comparable to that of traditional symbolic, static formal mathematics.

In particular, for test cases 21 through 25 in the test suite, despite the fact that the available memory was limited to only 35 GB, convergence was still achieved for approximately 67 million variables in fewer than 2,000 iterations. Under comparable 8D conditions, the Fugaku supercomputer would likely encounter NaN values within only a few hundred iterations, let alone achieve convergence. The specific difficulty of these test cases can be examined directly by analyzing the source code of the 7.7.3.py test suite.

In summary, all uploaded files collectively demonstrate that the performance of the ADC module combined with an RTX 2070 GPU—particularly for high-dimensional, parallel coupled computations, with 8D serving as a critical threshold—surpasses that of the Fugaku supercomputer. Live online video demonstrations can be provided at any time.

Files and variables
File: 7.7.2.py
Description: The most extensively tested version.

File: 7.7.3.py
Description: The latest 7.7.3 test suite is identical to the one used in this manuscript.

File: 7.7.2-10⁸（8D-12.5）.zip
Description: These are the execution logs and JSON files generated from runs of the early 7.7.2 test suite.

File: 7.7.3-10⁸（8D-12.22）.zip
Description: This directory contains the most critical test result files supporting this manuscript. All experimental results reported in the paper are derived from this folder. Early-stage experiments in the study primarily used version 7.7.2; for the convenience of review, all Chinese content in the 7.7.2 source code was translated into English, while all other aspects of the code and test content remain unchanged.

File: Other-LOG_and_JSON.zip
Description: This folder contains the execution logs and JSON output files generated under the recently executed 7.7.2.py test suite across a wide range of variable configurations. It should be emphasized that the test content of version 7.7.3 is identical to that of 7.7.2, with the only differences being that all content was translated into English and the individual test case names were removed. The original test names were considered overly exaggerated; therefore, they were deliberately removed to focus exclusively on the test content itself, resulting in the creation of 7.7.3.py.

File: JSON_history.zip
Description: This is a historical JSON file of ADC computation processes. From these computation traces, one can clearly observe the natural relaxation process based on a memory-as-field, in-memory computing paradigm. It is particularly noteworthy that the ADC is capable of automatic parameter self-adjustment. This file contains 271 distinct ADC computation runs, indirectly demonstrating that all computations are genuine and were actually performed.

File: Precise_Coupled_Reproduction_of_Gravitational_Electromagnetic_Nuclear_and_Inertial_Effects_within_the_Ψ-Potential_Dynamical_Framework.pdf
Description: This is the physical principle underlying the operation of the ADC topological quantum relaxation computing module.

Code/software
Academic English Translation:

The test suite must be executed in conjunction with the ADC computational module; however, the test cases themselves can also be extracted from the suite, with memory constraints, the 2000-iteration limit, and other restrictions removed, and then debugged and executed on a supercomputer. This allows a direct comparison of whether the ADC computational module and a supercomputer, when running the same test cases under identical conditions, can achieve convergence, or whether NaN values appear after only a few hundred iterations.

It should be noted that although the source code of the ADC computational module has not been publicly released, the uploaded execution logs and JSON files clearly demonstrate that the computation does not exhibit the characteristics of discretized mathematics under the Turing paradigm or the von Neumann architecture. More importantly, achieving such results under a true 8D setting is in itself sufficient to substantiate the claims.

Although the source code has not been disclosed, demonstrations can be provided in any form if required, or any high-dimensional, nonlocal, parallel-coupled problem can be presented for testing.
