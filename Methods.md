The source code of the ADC computational module originates from a newly developed physical theory—energy field theory, specifically its quantum relaxation component. Conventional digital computation is inherently based on discrete mathematics and single-dimensional stepwise decoupling, which makes it fundamentally unsuitable for solving nonlocal, high-dimensional, and massively parallel coupled mathematical problems. This intrinsic limitation gives rise to the well-known three fundamental bottlenecks of high-performance computing and the curse of dimensionality.

To address this issue, a novel mathematical framework, termed dynamic structured mathematics, was developed as a counterpart to traditional static formalized mathematics. Rather than decomposing problems through discretization, dynamic structured mathematics treats mathematical problems through the structural evolution of continuous fields. This approach is motivated by the observation that not all natural systems are decomposable: forced partitioning inevitably destroys intrinsic internal couplings. For example, a DNA sequence loses its functional integrity once arbitrarily segmented. Nature contains a wide class of systems that are holistic and fundamentally indivisible, and such systems cannot be accurately described or computed through conventional discretization-based methods.

Dynamic structured mathematics addresses nonlocal and indivisible mathematical problems by modeling them as evolving continuous structures instead of fragmented components. Within this framework, the ADC equation serves as the engineering blueprint of the ADC module used in topological quantum relaxation physical computation. Consequently, the ADC module is not derived from the Turing computational paradigm nor from the von Neumann architecture. It does not rely on conventional chip-based computational power; instead, it operates through a memory-centric, in-memory physical computation mechanism, in which quantum relaxation naturally emerges as a physical process within the memory field itself.

From a hierarchical perspective, the newly proposed energy field theory constitutes the theoretical root, dynamic structured mathematics forms the mathematical trunk, and the ADC-based topological quantum relaxation implementation represents the concrete engineering realization—the resulting manifestation of this theoretical framework. Therefore, energy field theory and dynamic structured mathematics are essential for understanding the design principles of the ADC computational module. Fundamentally, the ADC module does not originate from traditional computer architectures but represents a distinct physical computation paradigm grounded in continuous-field evolution rather than algorithmic discretization.
